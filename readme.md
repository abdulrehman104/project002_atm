# ATM Simulation

This project simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system where users can perform transactions such as withdrawals, checking balances, and accessing fast cash options. It collects user input regarding their account details, transaction type, and amount, and provides appropriate responses based on the user's input.

## Features

- **User Input:** Collects user ID, PIN, account type, transaction type, and amount based on the user's selection.
- **Account Types:** Supports both current and savings account types.
- **Transaction Types:** Offers options for withdrawal, fast cash, and checking current balance.
- **Random Balance:** Generates a random balance for the user's account for demonstration purposes.
- **Transaction Handling:** Deducts the requested amount from the user's account and provides feedback on the remaining balance or insufficiency of funds.
